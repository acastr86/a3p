                       <h1>Modeling</h1>
                       <p>This is the most important tool, its usefulness is not in the operations, because in fact its function is
                             declarative instead of behavior, but its declarative naturalization is what makes it such a valuable tool
                             since she is the one that shapes the operation of the company that can be understood by humans and at the same time is
                             interpreted and executed by the other agents that are part of the a3P proposal.
                       </p>
                       <p>The statement accommodates various data entry formats allowing customers to accommodate whatever they want.
                             more suitable to carry out your work, either graphically or text level. Various components allow documents
                             Standard of best policies advised or required by legislation are consumed transparently in the application.
                       </p>
                       <p>Regardless of how the system is modeled, it uses standard document references as a source to provide
                             validation that guides us within the process of creating the company's modeling. In this process several concepts are of utmost importance
                             that are handled and pending before beginning the process.

                            <p> All the definitions created in the modeling are automatically put to the test to be able to validate if what the system
