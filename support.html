                            <p>Our support service is an example of what can be achieved with this system, this service
                                runs entirely managed for the a3P familiy of solutions.
                            </p>
                            <p>The conversation times for each client are governed by an SLA which automatically creates the modeling of the policy, process and procedue for each plan or custom agreement.

                                    a priority queue based on the type of subcription your company owns, the answer is not anyway
                                    immediate when using this option and response time varies based on many factors.

                                <dd>Here you have direct access to staff who can answer your questions and there is also a queue based on
                                    the type of subscription, the time of the conversation is also variable by the type of subscription.

								the device they are using at the moment without having to install any remote access tool. Any problem creates a ticket
								and your subscription have a limited number of tickets per month.

                                <dd>This type of support is the equivalent of adding a new employee in your company but without having the physical person, with the advantages offered by this system, the location in which the new resource is located does not make any impact. For example, you need a person who can follow the policies, processes and procedures when there is a problem with a system, but you do not have the person with the skills in your company, we offer you the solution with this option without having to hire and train a new staff for such purposes.
