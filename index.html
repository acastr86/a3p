                    <h1>What is the problem?</h1>
                    <p>Currently each company faces a rather complex situation consciously or unconsciously, they cannot be
                        account for the loss of time and errors that are the result of not having policies, processes and procedures that ensure
                        the repetitiveness of the tasks that are part of the day to day; Those who come to have such an evolution are submerged in a group of
                        documents, which is where they are stored, which makes it quite tedious to pass it from employee to employee and even worse to ensure that
                        each employee perfectly understands their part, so they turn to supervisors to alleviate this problem a little.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Actually the most serious problem is that each company uses a set of systems that are black boxes among themselves, which leads to repetition of tasks
                      and on the other hand is the dissociation of clear goals and objectives tied to all these procedures, the problem intensifies more and is where some begin to occur
                      account, when there is change of personnel all the time in training without assurance that everything will be tied to policies that only exist on paper, in turn, this puts into question
                      the reputation of the company.
                    </p>
                    <h2>What is the solution?</h2>
                    <p>The solution to this problem is not based on the traditional way of creating a solution, as it is well known that each problem has a myriad of solutions and if we make the mistake of embarking on a solution
                        we would have to rewrite it to adapt it to new solutions that are more optimal, but even worse every time there are changes to the problems of the company which are given in their language there would be a
                        impedance between the language of the solution and the language of the problem. For this reason the problem is covered by first expressing exactly what the problem is in the language of the problem, creating the semantic
                        of the problem, in this way all the actors, including the computer, will be able to understand perfectly the definition of what is created and will be able to be active entities to suggest changes that grammatically speaking are not
                        compatible with the problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                          The approach with which to face this reality begins by first understanding the current systems used in the company, whether manual or digital, the understanding of them leads
                          to a <a href="modeling.html" title="a3P Modeling"> modeling </a> of them. As each company uses applications to help in their work and which are part of the established processes, the next step is to automate the interaction of
                          them either to execute them dynamically or to monitor that they have been executed as stipulated. This integration with the existing systems is done in a semantic way, removing the black box function
                          that these APPs currently have and give a semantic sense to the problem.

                  <article class="solution">
                       <p>To support the execution in accordance with the policies, processes and procedures of each company, a set of solutions has been created, but these hide their interface
                           behind a semantic environment to ensure that each of them is replaceable and there is no dependence on any particular solution; the solution is the one that adapts to the problem not the problem
                           to the solution.

                                of shared knowledge of the optional or legally required standards according to the industry.

                                 After defining the policies, processes and procedures, we need a way to know
                                 how its execution is going at all times and a way to create alerts when procedures are done or not, that they go against our policies and could affect the company. A set of tools allow
                                 being able to visualize the execution of each process in the company. Baseline is used to detect anomalies in correct operation.

                                     Sometimes the procedures that we must follow are not isolated actions, but depend on
                                     certain decisions or actions of others to be executed or even external systems, for those situations
                                     You have tools that allow you to define the flow of these relationships. Some of those can become protocols
                                     that specify who an when each should be executed.

                                       When we have to use APPs within our processes this tool allows me to monitor
